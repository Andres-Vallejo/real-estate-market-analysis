# Real Estate Market Analysis

Market analytics project focused on property prices, neighborhoods, size, price per square meter, and listing dynamics.

## Business Questions

- Which neighborhoods command the highest prices?
- How does property size relate to price?
- Where are listings moving fastest?
- What factors should buyers and sellers watch?

## Repository Structure

```text
data/                 Sample data for the case study
src/                  Python analysis workflow
sql/                  SQL queries for KPI extraction
reports/              Executive summary and recommendations
outputs/              Generated analysis outputs, ignored by git
requirements.txt      Python dependencies
```

## How To Run

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python src/analysis.py
```

The script reads `data/sample_data.csv`, creates KPI summaries, and saves generated outputs in `outputs/`.
